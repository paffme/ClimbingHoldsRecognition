# ClimbingHoldsRecognition
<p>
    The projet will use Deep Learning to segment climbing holds.
    To do, we are using
    <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/python/keras">Keras</a>
    and 
    <a href=https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow>Tensorflow</a>
    as library in Python.
</p>
<p>
    We are using
    <a href=https://github.com/jsbroks/coco-annotator>Coco-annotator</a>
    to annotate climbing holds on pictures
